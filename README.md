# Housing Habitability Prediction!
In this project, based on the given features like Property Type, Property Area, Number of Doors, Furnishing, Frequency of Powercuts, Power Backup Water Supply, Traffic Density Score, Crime Rate, Dust and Noise, Air Quality Index, Neighborhood Review in the data set predicted the Habitability Score for the houses. 

## Python Libraries Used:
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Seaborn
4. Matplotlib.pyplot
5. Sklearn

## Steps invole:
1. Importing different Python Libraries
2. Importing Data set
3. Data Exploration
4. Data Cleaning
5. Standardization (On Numerical columns) One hot encoding (On Categorical columns)
6. Data visualization
7. Data Preparation
8. Model Creation (Linear Regression Model)
9. Prediction
10. Accracy check (Using Mean squared error, Root mean squar error, Absolute Error, and R2 Score)

## Accuracy:
1. r2 Score =  0.5952475258109688
2. mean_squared_error =  80.5783149568078
3. mean_absolute_error =  7.225712659162546
4. root_mean_absolute_error =  8.976542483429117
 
After creating model (i.e., Linear Regression Model) got R2_Score as 0.59524 which is equal to 0.6, which means our model is neither bad nor the perfectly good model, but it is a good model.

("Linear regression is a simple but powerful machine learning algorithm that predicts a numeric value based on one or more input variables.")
