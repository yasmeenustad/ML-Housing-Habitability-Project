# Housing Habitability Prediction!
A Solo project by Myself. In this project, based on the given features like Property Type, Property Area, Number of Doors, Furnishing, Frequency of Powercuts, Power Backup Water Supply, Traffic Density Score, Crime Rate, Dust and Noise, Air Quality Index, Neighborhood Review in the data set predicted the Habitability Score for the houses. 

## Python Libraries Used:
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Seaborn
4. Matplotlib.pyplot
5. Sklearn

## Steps invole:
1. Importing different Python Libraries
2. Importing Data set
3. Data Exploration
4. Data Cleaning
5. Standardization (On Numerical columns) One hot encoding (On Categorical columns)
6. Data visualization
7. Data Preparation
8. Model Creation (Linear Regression Model)
9. Prediction
10. Accracy check (Using Mean squared error, Root mean squar error, Absolute Error, and R2 Score)

## Accuracy:
1. r2 Score =  0.5952475258109688
2. mean_squared_error =  80.5783149568078
3. mean_absolute_error =  7.225712659162546
4. root_mean_absolute_error =  8.976542483429117
 
After creating model (i.e., Linear Regression Model) got Root mean square error as 8.9 which is equal to 9, that is the Accuracy score is 91%. So the model is very good.


(Linear Regression: Linear regression is a simple but powerful machine learning algorithm that predicts a numeric value based on one or more input variables.)
